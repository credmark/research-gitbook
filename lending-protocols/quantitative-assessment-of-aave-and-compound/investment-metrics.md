# Investment Metrics

Cash flow assessment is a part of fundamental analysis used to derive the fair value of the organization, and consequently, its token price. Once the fair value of the token is known, itâ€™s then used to make asset management decisions about either buying, in case the market price is lower, or selling the token if the market price is higher. The current analysis might expand further in depth and width to provide such information and include other protocols.&#x20;

From a token holder perspective, Aave looks more attractive as its margin and, consequently, return is higher. Table 1 provides a quantitative summary of the analysis. For example, as of 13 October 2021, Aave has $42M monthly interest expense, which is an interest paid to all their depositors. In terms of generated cash inflows, it has $47M interest revenue per month, resulting in $5m net result. In relative terms, this is equivalent to 2.22% net interest margin per annum (NIM).&#x20;

As could be seen, the NIM of Aave is 58 basis points (or 0.58%) higher, therefore representing a better investment opportunity since NIM is expected to be distributed between token holders in benefits.

_Table 1 - Net Interest Margin Analysis_

| Protocol | Monthly Cost in $M | Monthly Revenue in $M | NIM   |   |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ----- | - |
| Aave     | 42.23              | 47.00                 | 2.22% |   |
| Compound | 18.48              | 21.04                 | 1.63% |   |



Table 2 provides information on the protocol-level borrowing and lending rates. As could be seen from the data as of 13 October 2021, the weighted average deposit rate for Aave is 2.85%, while the one for Compound is 1.43%, which is lower by 1.42%. Hence, for depositors, Aave also looks more attractive based on the offered yields.

| Protocol | Borrowing Rate | Lending Rate | Spread |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Aave     | 2.85%          | 7.50%        | 4.65%  |
| Compound | 1.43%          | 4.45%        | 3.02%  |
