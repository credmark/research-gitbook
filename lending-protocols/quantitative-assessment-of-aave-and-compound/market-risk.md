# Market Risk

Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a model to measure market risk. VaR is a statistical measure of the riskiness of financial exposure. It is defined as the maximum dollar amount expected to be lost over a given time horizon, at a pre-defined confidence level, and given normal market conditions.&#x20;

To measure the deposit's market risk, we selected a theoretical example of holding $1M equivalent in Ethereum (ETH).&#x20;

Based on 99% confidence level, 10-day holding period, and 1-year historical sampling window, the VaR of this position as of 6 October 2021 is equal to $379k. Table 3 outlines other Value-at-Risk estimates for different historical windows and holding periods.
