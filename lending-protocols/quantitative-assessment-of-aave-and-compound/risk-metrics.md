# Risk Metrics

Credmark maintains a risk register of the main risks identified in Defi protocols. The significant risks associated with Aave and Compound investigated in the current analysis are:&#x20;

**Market risk** – the risk of market price volatility measured in potential loss under normal conditions&#x20;

**Liquidity risk** – the risk that an organization will have insufficient funds to meet its financial commitments on time&#x20;

**Operational risk **- the risk of losses caused by flawed or failed processes, policies, systems, or events that disrupt business operations&#x20;

Although material, Credit risk is not included in the current assessment due to its widespread nature in the Defi space. Even first order protocols that are pegged to fiat, also known as stable coins, are prone to significant credit risk. We recommend managing credit risk by diversification. Credit risk is a possibility of a loss resulting from an organization or borrower’s failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations.&#x20;

Risk assessment of the protocol is helpful in decision-making for all counterparties involved – token holders, depositors, and borrowers.
