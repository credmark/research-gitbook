# Investment Metrics

Cash flow assessment is part of the fundamental analysis used to derive the fair value of any organization.&#x20;

An organization’s market value is the total value of its outstanding shares or tokens (market cap). For the Aave and Compound protocols we have considered their token market cap.&#x20;

Once the fair value of a token is known, it can be used to make asset management decisions. If the fair value is higher than the market value, the token should be bought, otherwise, it should be sold.&#x20;

From a token holder’s perspective, Aave is more attractive than Compound. Aave’s margin is higher. Table 1 provides a quantitative summary of the analysis. As of 13 October 2021, Aave has $42M of monthly interest expenses versus $47M of monthly interest revenues. This $5M difference implies a 2.22% net interest margin (NIM) per annum.&#x20;

Aave’s NIM is 58 basis points (0.58%) higher than Compound’s, therefore representing a better investment opportunity since NIM is expected to be distributed to token holders.
