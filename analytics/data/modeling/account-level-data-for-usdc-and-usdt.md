# Account level data for USDC and USDT

In order to monitor/measure account liquidity, the account level data for the holdings in stablecoins like USDC and USDT are to be tracked. This will be used to calculate [liquidity-coverage-ratio-lcr](../../metrics/liquidity-coverage-ratio-lcr/ "mention")

As they are both ERC20 tokens, this can be implemented with web3 API. The proposed application is to monitor the top 100 holders of USDC and USDT.
