# DeFi & Crypto-Specific Risks

Traditional finance has a strong existing risk infrastructure and knowledge base. As investors and institutions yeet assets over to Crypto and make use of the financial instruments in DeFi, we need to consider a new subset of risks.

Crypto is built on direct, distributed interactions between users. DeFi protocols are, by definition, transparent in nature. They broadcast their own programmed reactions to any action via the smart contract, so the uncertainty and reactiveness of human decision making is removed. This means that the safety of a protocol is based entirely on their ability to anticipate and account for abuse before it happens.

Mistakes are made by developers, who may not understand financial risks or be able to anticipate edge cases and exploits of the code.

**Uniquely Crypto Risk Properties**

Crypto has some unique properties that are both features and pose new problems. Self custody, implicit anonymity, low barrier to entry, hacks, rugs, and exploits, the inability to patch deployed code, 24 hour trading, lack of regulatory oversight and insurance, and lack of interception mechanisms all pose risks that didn’t exist in TradFi.

Self-Custody exposes users to the ability to lose access to their wallets with the loss of a mnemonic or private key. Private key exposure can grant unlimited and permanent access to bad actors. Both problems are without any means of reconciliation. It’s fair, but it’s brutal. Anonymity means that there’s limited legal recourse in a conflict. This is exaggerated by the low barrier to entry, allowing _rugs and ponzis and scams oh my!_ to be deployed by anyone, despite having no credentials, oversight, or accountability. Some projects actively seek out accreditation from TradFi institutions, but that is the exception, not the rule. Even if the developers have the best of intentions, the nature of smart contracts makes them impossible to fix. Protocols usually need their users to migrate their own assets in case of a smart contract code mistake. If you accidentally are giving out 10x the tokens than you intended, too bad, it’ll keep doing it, because you can’t change it. It’ll be traded around the clock, so you’d best not go to sleep post-launch.
