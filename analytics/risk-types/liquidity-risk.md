# Liquidity Risk

Liquidity Risk is the risk of you not being able to retrieve or liquidate an asset. This is applicable to all assets, but especially wrapped assets.&#x20;

Since many DeFi protocols issue a vaulted, wrapped, or staked version of underlying assets, a user's ability to exchange it back is especially important, and measured in liquidity risk.&#x20;

Liquidity is also important to consider when calculating loss due to slippage, which is relevant when interacting with Dexes for both traders and liquidity providers.
