# Curve Finance Pools Data Extraction

## Summary

One of the institutional clients sponsored work to develop a model that extracts information on  Curve Finance pools. It is used to monitor macro healthiness of DeFi. The following information is captured and made available through Credmark API service:

1. Pool Number
2. Tokens contained in the pool
3. Balances of these tokens

The data is available for all pools and can be also run historically.
