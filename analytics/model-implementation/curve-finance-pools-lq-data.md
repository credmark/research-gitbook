# Curve Finance Pools Data Extraction

## Summary

Inspired by the discussion with a institutional client, a model was developed that extracts information on Curve Finance LP pools. It shall be used to monitor liquidity and yield at one of DeFis largest protocols. The following information is captured and made available through Credmark API service:

1. Pool Number
2. Tokens contained in the pool
3. Balances of these tokens

The data is available for all pools and can be also run historically.
