**History/Context + Risk Assessment: **

USDC was launched in 2018 by the Centre Consortium, founded and most prominently backed by Circle and Coinbase. The company originally purported to be backed 100% by US Dollars, and advertised itself accordingly. However, in the face of regulatory scrutiny and user-demands for clarity on how USDC was backed, the organization released a report in July of 2021 indicating that only 61% of its reserves were cash, with debt instruments such as bonds making up the balance. In the most recent report, that number has slipped to 47%.  In terms of large-cap stablecoins, USDC is well collateralized, but there is still risk. In the event of a massive run on USDC, not all holders would be able to redeem their USDC for US Dollars, with some of the underlying collateral having 3 year maturity periods before payback.

USDCâ€™s price can also fluctuates on secondary markets (i.e. when you are not purchasing USDC from the Centre Consortium). Particularly in DeFi, USDC is a medium to move out of volatile assets without converting to fiat. If, for example, the price of bitcoin plummets and traders want to convert to USDC, the price can rise slightly.

Despite misleading consumers with prior claims that USDC is 100% US dollar or equivalent-backed, it has a better track record in transparency and security than comparable high-cap stablecoins. USDC has published audits from independent accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP certifying that they are sufficiently capitalized since October 2018.\
