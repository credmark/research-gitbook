# Bridges

In order to take advantage of the speed and low costs of L2 side chains, you first have to send funds from the Ethereum main chain to these L2s. To do so, you make use of so-called bridges that allow to transfer token in both directions but the transfer (depending on the L2 network you choose) may take some time.&#x20;

While [Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io), [Polygon](https://wallet.polygon.technology/login?next=%2Fbridge), or [Optimism](https://app.optimism.io/bridge) offer native "bridging" of funds, there exist specialized protocols as well to help users make the transition more easily and faster.

As with every DeFi protocol, these bridges are as well subject to risks for hacks, exploits, and smart contract bugs.
