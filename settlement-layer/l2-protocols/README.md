# L2 Protocols

The Layer-2-protocols or L2 refer to solutions for the Ethereum main chain (Layer 1 or L1) to help reduce gas fees and increase transaction throughput. The growing demand from DeFi and especially from NFTs in 2021 had enormous effects on the ETH gas market \[1].

In order to give users alternatives to using the Ethereum L1 and pay hundreds of Dollars for simple transfers or swaps (which made using DeFi not inclusive as originally intended), various scaling solutions tried to become a valid alternative. The promise of all of them was to allow users to use Ethereum as it was meant to be and having high transaction speed at affordable low costs.

The way these L2s are reaching the goal can be summarized as follows \[2]:

* L2s process transaction on a sidechain connected to the Ethereum main chain
* They roll up many transaction into one large transaction (or block)
* This roll up is sent to the main chain in one transaction instead of several individual ones

Based on these solutions, Ethereum tries to counter many of the so-called "ETH-Killers", referring to alternative Layer 1 blockchains, like Solana, Avalanche, or Fantom. Layer 2 solutions pretend to offer all the benefits like low cost and high speed while also offering the security of the Ethereum main chain. On the other hand, to get to this goal, these L2s are often less decentralized then the L1 main chain.
