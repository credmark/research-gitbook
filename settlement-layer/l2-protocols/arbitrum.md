# Arbitrum

[Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io) is a Layer 2 scaling solution created by Offchain Labs, and officially launched in August 2021. It makes use of so-called optimistic rollups and settles transaction in batches to the Ethereum main chain \[1].

Arbitrum claims to be capable of processing 40,000 transactions per second (Ethereum can handle 14) while fully supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) \[2]. Thus, any DeFi application can be simply bridged to Arbitrum - and [many have done so already](https://portal.arbitrum.one).&#x20;

The current TVL of Arbitrum as of May 2022 is roughly 2bn USD, the current numbers can be found [here](https://defillama.com/chain/Arbitrum) \[3].

Following the [Arbitrum Developer Documentation](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside\_arbitrum), at the most basic level level, the chain works like that:
