# Convex

Curve Finance is a community-owned and governed protocol, with the Curve DAO token (CRV) at its center. The high-level purposes of CRV are to incentivize liquidity providers in the Curve Finance ecosystem as well as get as many members involved as possible in the governance of the protocol \[1].
