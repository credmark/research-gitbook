# Stablecoins

## Introduction

Stablecoins are one of the most important aspects of DeFi. Having stable assets in otherwise highly volatile markets has greatly expanded the ability of projects to fundraise in crypto, and enabled traders to move in and out of unstable assets without converting to fiat. Stablecoins are typically pegged to the US Dollar and generally treated as cash. However, not all stable coins are created equally- some carry very little risk and are rightfully treated as cash, while others carry substantially more risk.

The key to understanding risk in stablecoins is to understand how they are backed, or collateralized. A stablecoin effectively acts as an IOU for asset that is backing it. If a market participant goes and buys 100 USDC, they do so on the assumption that they can, at will, redeem that USDC for 100 US dollars. If a stablecoin is insufficiently collateralized and a large number of stablecoin holders attempt to redeem their tokens, but the issuer is unable to pay them back, the price will drop below the advertised peg.

In TradeFi, the currency is reserved-backed. In DeFi, there are two basic varieties of stablecoin backing: 1) algorithmic and 2) asset-backed stablecoins.

## Algorithmic Stablecoins

Fully decentralized tokens backed by blockchain-native assets (such as other cryptocurrencies).

Fully decentralized assets are much more pure to the ethos of DeFi in that they cannot be controlled by a central authority (or, for now, regulator). A typical decentralized stablecoin is minted by a smart contract based on the amount of collateral that is deposited. In locking up an unstable asset, more stable assets are minted. Supply is managed via an algorithm to maintain a peg. However, as the crypto markets have shown us, fully decentralized stablecoins are still very fallible.

Using unstable assets is inherently risky. Even if the smartcontract governing a stablecoin is academically sound, rapid fluctuations in the value of collateral can cause a stablecoin to lose its peg. In the case of the IRON, a stablecoin created by TITAN, one of the underlying assets collapsed to zero, effectively removing the peg to USD. To date, there has yet to be a fully decentralized stablecoin that can truly maintain a peg.

## Asset-Backed Stablecoins

Stablecoins that live on chain, but are backed by offchain, centrally controlled assets such as US dollars.

Stablecoins backed by a centralized asset tend to fluctuate less, but even within this category of assets there are levels of risk. The gold standard for a centrally-backed stablecoin is 100% backing by US dollars or short term treasury bills. This would ensure that, if there were a run on the stablecoin, all of the holders would be able to redeem the on-chain coins they hold for a fiat equivalent. That way, if there were a run on the stablecoin the price would never dip below the peg. However, the most common stablecoins are only partially backed by cash, filling in the gap with longer-term debt instruments (such as certificates of deposit) or even debt issued by the stablecoin parent company.
