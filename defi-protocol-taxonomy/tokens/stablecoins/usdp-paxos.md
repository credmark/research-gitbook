# USDP (paxos)

**Market Cap:** $945.2 million, as of 17 November2021&#x20;

**Collateralization Mechanism & Details:** Paxos is 100% backed by US dollars and US treasuries&#x20;

**History/Context + Risk Assessment:** Paxos, the organization behind the Pax Dollar, is a regulatory-centric blockchain infrastructure platform. They offer enterprise exchange and brokerage services in addition to USDP. Originally launched in September of 2018 as “Paxos Standard”, USDP has been advertised as fully collateralized and regulated since going to market. To ensure their stable coin is fully “in the fence” from a regulatory standpoint, Paxos has deliberately instituted a number of standards, including:&#x20;

1. Independent audit reports from launch to present&#x20;

&#x20; 2\. Burning any USDP in the market if it is redeemed for fiat&#x20;

&#x20; 3\. Maintaining a status as a NY Department of Financial Services-approved Trust Company&#x20;

While USDP benefited from Paxos’ long standing in the Crypto industry (particularly from the operation of their operation of the ItBit exchange), its extremely conservative regulatory approach certainly accelerated the token’s proliferation. In the first 5 weeks after launch, it expanded to over 20 exchanges and OTC desks and issued over 50 million USDP.&#x20;

From a risk perspective, USDP is positioned well relative to other stablecoins. While it shares the underlying risk of being built on top of ethereum, it is protected from bank runs by being fully collateralized. Additionally, with regulation looming, it appears to be the best situated to continue operating BAU should any stablecoin specific laws or enforcement go into effect.&#x20;

As the regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins have increased, other stablecoins have followed in the footsteps of USDP to meet impending regulatory approval. Of significant note, in the fall of 2021 USDC moved to become fully collateralized by cash or US treasuries. USDC is also working to become a Full Reserve National Commercial Bank regulated by the US government.
