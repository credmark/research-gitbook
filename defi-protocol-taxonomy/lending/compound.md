# Compound

Compound is a decentralized protocol which establishes money markets with algorithmically set interest rates based on supply and demand, allowing users to frictionlessly exchange the time value of Ethereum assets.To achieve this The interest rate is set and updated every 10 seconds depending on the supply and demand of a specific asset \[1].

## 1. Is it a Protocol or a Token? - Both Protocol and Token

Compound is a lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that establishes money markets, which are pools of assets with algorithmically derived interest rates, based on the supply and demand for the asset. Suppliers (and borrowers) of an asset interact directly with the protocol, earning (and paying) a floating interest rate, without having to negotiate terms such as maturity, interest rate, or collateral with a peer or counterparty \[2]. Currently compound only supports Dai (DAI), Ether (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), Ox (ZRX), Tether (USDT), Wrapped BTC (WBTC), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur (REP), and Sai (SAI)\[3].

The native Token of the Protocol is COMP, which is a Governance Token.
