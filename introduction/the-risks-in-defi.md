# The Risks in DeFi

There are 4 main types of Risk that we investigate in DeFi.

### Market Risk

Market Risk is the risk of the price of an asset or portfolio going down.&#x20;

This is primarily measured in historical volatility in the price of an asset. Market risk allows us to simulate the likelihood of various stress scenarios, and gain confidence in probability and severity of market based shocks.

### Liquidity Risk

Liquidity Risk is the risk of you not being able to retrieve or liquidate an asset. This is applicable to all assets, but especially wrapped assets.&#x20;

Since many DeFi protocols issue a vaulted, wrapped, or staked version of underlying assets, a user's ability to exchange it back is especially important, and measured in liquidity risk.&#x20;

Liquidity is also important to consider when calculating loss due to slippage, which is relevant when interacting with Dexes for both traders and liquidity providers.

### Credit Risk

Credit Risk is the risk of a counter-party not meeting their financial obligations. Since much of DeFi is automated and anonymous, this is slightly less relevant than in traditional finance, but there are cases when it must be considered.

### Operational Risk

Operational Risk is the risk that a protocol is mismanaged, or the opportunity for mechanical failure leading to losses. This includes centralization and regulatory risk on the governance side, and smart-contract and integration risk on the technical side.
