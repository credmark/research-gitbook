# How can I contribute to the Risk Library?

The Risk Library is a community curated space dedicated to DeFi and Risk knowledge.

Our **ultimate goal** is to allow the Credmark community to:

* create,
* improve, and&#x20;
* validate

all content in the library.&#x20;

Our **current goal** is to allow the Credmark community to create content for the [DEFI PROTOCOL TAXONOMY](broken-reference) section of the library.&#x20;

Every new submission of content will be assessed by a Review Committee, whose members are elected by a Governance vote. This committee will ensure quality, provide feedback and ultimately reward contributors.

## How To

In order to avoid a complicated copy & paste process of content, we have decided to give every member of the community, who is eager to contribute, direct access to the Risk Library GitBook.&#x20;

To add new content, please:

1. Copy this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IeolO8ypUd9rfL0RAEpbfqdFXOQBJwNmdZJOHZxUk9I/edit#heading=h.cf4f9nn4lucc).
2. Do your research and document your finding.
3. Follow the shared link in the [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/827615638540910622/930928637975335012) for the Risk Library. This link will give you EDITOR rights to the Risk Library, so you can
   * create a change request for a specific page you want to contribute,
   * edit the page and provide your research directly there, and
   * submit the change request, so that your contribution can be reviewed and published.
4. Write a short request for review in the risk-library section of the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BJbYSRDdtr) server.
5. Someone from the Risk Library Content Review Committee will pick it up and engage with you to make sure the submission meets our quality standards.&#x20;
6. Once the review is done, the change request of the content will be accepted, published to the Risk Library and you will be sent a reward for your submission.&#x20;

In case you have any questions, suggestions or other feedback, please let us know on Discord. Please also take the time to look into the specific GitBook instructions:

## Rewards

Rewards amount depends on how much value the Review Committee places on your submission as well as the amount of effort required to get it to publication. Rewards will be in $CMK.&#x20;

For full transparency, reward amounts are always listed in a document's final "Contributors" section.&#x20;

## Recognition

At the end of every Risk Library document you'll find a "Contributors" section like the one below. It lists:

* Contributor's Discord handle, Twitter handle or whatever you prefer to be identified by.
* Contributor's ETH address. This is where rewards are sent and where readers can send tips.
* The amount of $CMK sent as a reward for the contribution.
* Any relevant comments.
