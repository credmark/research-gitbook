# How can I contribute to the Risk Library?

The Risk Library is a community curated space dedicated to DeFi and Risk knowledge.

Our **ultimate goal** is to allow the Credmark community to:

* create,
* improve, and&#x20;
* validate

all content in the library.&#x20;

Our **current goal** is to allow the Credmark community to create content for the [DEFI PROTOCOL TAXONOMY](broken-reference) section of the library.

## How To

1. Copy this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IeolO8ypUd9rfL0RAEpbfqdFXOQBJwNmdZJOHZxUk9I/edit#heading=h.cf4f9nn4lucc).
2. Do your research and document your finding.
3. Add your document to this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cZFsViWVCxWBYPWAXSSrAP11PE4OhtyD?usp=sharing).
4. Paste a link to your document along with a request for review in the risk-library section of our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BJbYSRDdtr) server.
5. Someone from the Risk Library Content Review Committee will pick it up and engage with you to make sure the submission meets our quality standards. Once it does, the content will be copied to the Risk Library and you will be sent a reward for your submission.&#x20;

## Rewards

Rewards amount depends on how much value the Review Committee places on your submission as well as the amount of effort required to get it to publication. Rewards will be in $CMK.&#x20;

For full transparency, reward amounts are always listed in a document's final "Contributors" section.&#x20;

## Recognition

At the end of every Risk Library document you'll find a "Contributors" section like the one below. It lists:

* Contributor's Discord handle.
* Contributor's ETH address. This is where rewards are sent and where readers can send tips.
* The amount of $CMK sent as a reward for the contribution.
* Any relevant comments.
