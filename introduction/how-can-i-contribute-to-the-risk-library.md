# How can I contribute to the Risk Library?

As aforementioned, the Risk Library is a community curated space dedicated to DeFi and Risk knowledge. So there are a lot of areas that need input, validation and curation of content.&#x20;

As we try to build a comprehensive encyclopedia of DeFi protocols, tokens and all DeFi-related topics, contributing to the [DEFI PROTOCOL TAXONOMY](broken-reference) is the easiest way to start and to get things going. You will find a dedicated template [here](../defi-protocol-taxonomy/introduction.md) to start your work while this will assure a certain standard of high quality content.

Moreover, we love to listen to your thoughts, insights & questions and discuss them with you in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BJbYSRDdtr). So make sure to join, share your ideas for new content to the Risk Library and we will pay attention to it, let the community review it and finally publish it.&#x20;
