# What is the Risk Library?

The Risk Library is a community curated space of Research on the Risks associated with DeFi and the specific token and protocols.&#x20;

It is divided into three major sections

* ANALYTICS,&#x20;
* FRAMEWORKS, and&#x20;
* DEFI PROTOCOL TAXONOMY.

In the [**ANALYTICS**](broken-reference) section, we explain risk and how it can be measured, describe classes of models and computable metrics for success for those models and finally the data needed, to back these models.

The [**FRAMEWORKS**](broken-reference) section contains specific risk management frameworks, tools and strategies in order to mitigate different types of risk depending on your specific use case.

Finally, in the [**DEFI PROTOCOL TAXONOMY**](broken-reference) section, you'll find descriptions and comparisons of DeFi Protocols, how we categorize them, and what you need to know about the downsides of using them.
