# What is the Risk Library?

The Risk Library is community curated Research on the Risks associated with DeFi, tokens, and protocols.&#x20;

It is divided into three major sections:

* ANALYTICS,&#x20;
* FRAMEWORKS, and&#x20;
* DEFI PROTOCOL TAXONOMY.

In the [**ANALYTICS**](broken-reference) section, we explain various risks and how they can be measured. We also describe classes of models and the data they require.

The [**FRAMEWORKS**](broken-reference) section contains specific risk management frameworks, tools and strategies needed to mitigate different types of risks.

Finally, in the [**DEFI PROTOCOL TAXONOMY**](broken-reference) section, we describe DeFi Protocols, categorize them, and list any risks associated with their use.
