# Why should I contribute to the Risk Library?

Understanding and quantifying risk in DeFi is important.&#x20;

We need research, we need tools, we need models. The Credmark project is working to address all these needs.&#x20;

If you:

1. agree that understanding and quantifying risk in DeFi is important, and
2. have a background in DeFi, traditional finance, or risk,

you should consider contributing to the Risk Library.&#x20;

Credmark rewards high-quality contributions, but we hope you won't just do it for the $CMK. This is a community-wide effort to improve the state of DeFi. If you can help, please join us.
