# What's a Risk Library?

Welcome to the Credmark Risk Library, here you can talk loudly and we don't use the dewey decimal system.&#x20;

This is a community curated library of research on the Risks associated with DeFi protocols. Here you'll find descriptions and comparisons of DeFi Protocols, how we categorize them, and what you need to know about the downsides of using them.

This Library is how we'll be defining the data available on the Credmark Data Platform, and it's a chance for collaborators to let us know what's important.
