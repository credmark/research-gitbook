# Introduction

Traditional finance has a strong existing risk infrastructure and knowledge base. As investors and institutions yeet assets over to Crypto and make use of the financial instruments in DeFi, we need to consider a new subset of risks.

Thus, we will do a deep dive into [DeFi & Crypto-specific risks](broken-reference) and explore what makes DeFi special in terms of the risk you will encounter.

Afterwards, we will look at some established risk measures for [Market Risk](broken-reference) and [Liquidity Risk](broken-reference) and how this can be applied to DeFi.

Finally, we take a look at [Operational Risk](broken-reference) with focus on Legal Risk as this a very special circumstance many DAOs and Protocol need to pay attention to.
