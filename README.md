# The Credmark Wiki

Credmark is a financial modeling platform powered by reliable on-chain data. Validated models are readily composable making rapid app development simple.

The Credmark ecosystem is built upon three pillars, the Data API, the Credmark Wiki, and the Credmark Platform.

The Credmark Wiki provides context as well as best practices for **FINANCIAL MODELING** in DeFi, without the expectation to ever be fully complete.

The FINANCIAL MODELING section is made up of three sub-chapters, so

* Dealing with Risks,
* Smart Money in DeFi,
* Data Fundamentals

[**Dealing with Risks**](https://docs.credmark.com/dealing-with-risks/) **** provides an overview of DeFi & Crypto-specific risks as well as established risk metrics like VaR and LCR and how to measure and apply them within a DeFi context.

[**Smart Money in DeFi**](https://docs.credmark.com/smart-money-in-defi/) **** explains relevant approaches to analyze, optimize and measure performance and risks for a DeFi-portfolio.

Finally, [**Data Fundamentals**](https://docs.credmark.com/data-fundamentals/) describes the necessary underlying data that is required for modeling.
