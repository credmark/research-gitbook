# Introduction

The Data Fundaments circle around the Sourcing, Controlling and Analysis of data used for Financial Modeling. Since any model requires high-quality and reliable data, methods are presented on how to retrieve, check, clean and analyze blockchain data to gain deep insights.

The first section [Sourcing](broken-reference) explicitly addresses how to obtain appropriate on-chain data and how to deal with data issues.

The second section [Controls](broken-reference) explains Data discrepancy and how to handle it.

Finally, the third section [Transactional Data Analysis](broken-reference) shows methods for analyzing and drawing conclusions from data at the protocol and account level.
